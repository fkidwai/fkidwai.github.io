        <ol>
            <li>Design:</li>
            <p>I like how the design is kept pretty simple. Nice font size, nice color contrast. There is nice little slideshow, which looks good in the website.</p>
            <li>Page:</li>
            <p>The page is consist of header, main, and footer. Has reponsive navbar, which is also consistent throughout the website.</p>
            <li>Header</li>
            <p>There is no logo, or brand name but there is a person name in center nice and big. </p>
            <li>Main:</li>
            <p>Main has h2 and there is no tagline or slogan.</p>
            <li>Footer:</li>
            <p>Footer is empty throughout the whole website, I think you could have put contact info in footer instead of putting it in "school work" section.</p>
            <li>Overall:</li>
            <p>The website is kept pretty simple which is good, but it would look better if there were some more content with different design and style, but this looks good too, I guess.</p>
