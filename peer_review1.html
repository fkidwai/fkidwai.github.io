            <ol>
                <li>Design:</li>
                <p>Design is really good, I like how the site has image on the home page, and have really nice navabar and footer. Nice font, font-size, and nice color combination.</p>
                <li>Page:</li>
                <p>The page is consist of header, main, and footer. Also has responsive navabar.</p>
                <li>Header</li>
                <p>Has nice navbar, has big logo of the website which is good.</p>
                <li>Main:</li>
                <p>Main startes with h2 and does not consist of website name on the page. Website has a tagline on the main page, but it's not on everypage. Infact only main page has information, all the other pages are empyt, has nothing in it except the page title.</p>
                <li>Footer:</li>
                <p>All pages have footer. Footer consist of website name and all the socials. Footer is not consistent throughout the website.</p>
                <li>Overall:</li>
                <p>In my opinion the website is good but it would be better if all the pages had something in it.</p>
