                    <p class="hobbySectionP">
                        Welcome to my UFC(Ultimate Fighting Championship) hobby website! UFC is an organization that holds
                        mixed martial arts(MMA) fights. MMA is the art of fighting using techniques of various combat sports. You can combine 
                        techniques of various combat sports such as wrestling, kickboxing, muy thai, etc. 
                        We cover everything from the basics of different fighting styles to advanced techniques, strategies, and rules. You'll also 
                        find articles about the history and culture of UFC, as well as profiles of legendary players and teams.
                        I am someone that went from never watching sports to becoming obsesed with UFC, the leader of combat sports in the world! 
                        I think the reason why I became hooked to UFC is because of how raw it is. This is the purest form of fighting. 
                        You can hit someone with punches, kicks,knees, elbows, and take people down and submit them.

                    <p class="hobbySectionP">I started watching UFC during my sophmore year of high school. I got into it because one of my friends was
                        posting about one of his favorite fighers on his instagram and I decided to check that fighter out. Next thing you know I'm hooked
                        to UFC, and have been watching every main event since then.

                    <p class="hobbySectionP">UFC fights happen through the year. They are not held to a specific season like other sports.
                        It is very much like boxing where fighters choose when & whenever they want to fight and they can fight throughout the year. 
                        On average most UFC fighters fight 2-4 times per year. Even though fighters fight an average of 3 times per year, the UFC 
                        holds fights every week. Most weeks its small fights for unranked and lower ranked fighters called "Fight Night". Usually once 
                        a month they have title fights called UFC ###, some number.

                <h2 class="hobbySectionHeading">Why</h2>

                <div class="hobbyPPadding">

                    <h3>There are many reasons why someone might start want to learn to fight. Here are a few possible reasons:</h3>

                    <br>

                    <p class="hobbySectionP">Some people may be drawn to UFC simply because they enjoy watching sport. They may find it exciting, challenging, and rewarding.</p>
                    <p class="hobbySectionP">UFC can be a great way to meet new people and make friends. Joining a MMA team or club can provide opportunities to socialize and 
                        connect with others who share your interest in the sport.</p>
                    <p class="hobbySectionP">UFC is a physically demanding sport that requires a lot of cardio, endurance, and grit. Compteing in MMA can be a great way to stay 
                        active and improve your physical fitness.</p>
                    <p class="hobbySectionP">For some people, the competitive aspect of UFC is what draws them to the sport. Compteing in matches can provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.</p>
                    <p class="hobbySectionP">Some people might want to learn MMA for self defense. So they can protect themself.</p>
                    <p class="hobbySectionP">This one is very important to me, and probably the primary reason why I compete in MMA. MMA can help with personal development, such as 
                        building confidence, teamwork, and leadership skills. These qualities can be valuable both in and outside the cage.</p>
